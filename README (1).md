| host        | <p>A host refers to a device or computer that is connected to a network and is capable of communicating with other devices on that network. A host can be a server, a personal computer, a mobile device, or any other device that has the capability to connect to a network. For example, there could be multiple hosts, such as servers, workstations, and laptops inside a company's internal network.</p><p>A host is identified on a network by its IP address, which is a unique numerical label.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                  |
| IP address  | <p>An IP address is used to identify and locate a device on a network. For example, imagine you're using your laptop at work. And you need to access the company's internal file server. To connect to it you can use its IP address.</p><p>An IP address is usually written in the format of four sets of numbers separated by dots, like this: 192.168.0.1. This format is called IPv4, and it is the most widely used IP address format today. Note that each of the four sets of numbers in an IPv4 address can range from 0 to 255.</p><p>An additional format called IPv6 exists, and this will gradually be used more and more often in the future. IPv6 addresses are a bit more complex and use hexadecimal digits instead of decimal. Decimal notation uses digits between 0 and 9, while hexadecimal uses digits from 0 to 9, but also A, B, C, D, E, and F, which are used as additional digits. An example of an IPv6 address is 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329. We can see that many more numbers are used this time, and they are separated by colons (":") instead of dots.</p><p><br></p>         |                                                                                                                  |
| Port number | <p>Now let's think about what happens when a host receives some data over the network. Let's imagine some server just received data on its IP address. This server has tens of applications running on it. A new dilemma arises. What should it do with this data? What application should receive it? This problem is solved with the help of ports.</p><p>An <strong>IP address identifies a host</strong>, but <strong>a port identifies an application</strong> on that host.</p><p>When you type "kodekloud.com" in your web browser, your computer sends data to a host, one of KodeKloud's servers. But for this data's destination, it doesn't just use an IP address, but also a port. In this case, port 443, which is used for encrypted HTTPS connections. When KodeKloud's server sees this data was sent to port 443, it instantly knows that it should forward it to a web server application running on it, such as Nginx, or Apache.</p><p>Now that we have a fundamental understanding of key networking concepts, let's dive into the details of different types of communication within Kubernetes.</p> |                                                                                                                  |
